      <p>The first known palindrome dates back to 70 AD. It is graffitied on the walls of the Herculeaneum and reads "Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas," which roughly translates to "The sower Arepo holds his plough with effort."</p>

      <p>Funnily enough, the word palindrome is not a palindrome, but the reverse of palindrome, emordnilap, is a word. Emordnilap is a word that when spelled backwards creates a new word, like dressed and stressed!</p>
